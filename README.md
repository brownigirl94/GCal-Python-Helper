# GCal-Python-Helper
A simple python script to count specific event types in google calendar

To get started:
------

See [Google's Python QuickStart](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/python)

Instead of Step 3, You can use this event counter to count how many events of a specific format are occuring in the next *n* days 

Notes from the human who tried to write this:
------

*Script needs needs ironing out. It won't delete anything off your calendar, but also won't handle all inputs.* 

It's the sort of $2 kid's swiss army knife equivilant instead of those fancy $200 Iron-Man style tools you may see on here? If that makes scence?? Ok, I'll try to fix this tomorrow, time for me to go to sleep. Goodnight, world..
